# Supervised-Learning-Algorithms

The project contains implemetation for various Supervised ML algorithms include=ing:
-libsvm
-Multiclass KSVM 
-Random Forests
-Convoluted Neural Networks
-Multi-Layer Perceptron
-Na√Øve Bayes 
-AdaBoost. 

These algorithms were implemented on three different datasets:
-Breast Cancer Dataset
-Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits Data Set 
-Forest type mapping dataset
